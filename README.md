# Coin Change JavaScript Project

This is a simple JavaScript project that calculates the least amount of coins needed to reach a given value.

## How to Use

To use the coin change calculator, simply click on the "Calculate" button and enter the desired value (between 20-100) in the input field. The calculator will then display the least amount of coins needed to reach that value.

The calculator works with the following denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20.

## Customization

You can customize the denominations used by the calculator by modifying the tokens variable in the script.js file.
